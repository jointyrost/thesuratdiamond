                    Lab grown diamonds and mined diamonds are essentially perfect in terms of their chemical makeup, being composed of pure carbon. The only difference is their origin: lab grown diamonds are created in controlled environments using high temperatures and pressure, while mined diamonds are extracted from the earth's crust. Lab grown diamonds are a leading ethical and sustainable option, as they avoid the human rights issues and environmental impacts associated with mined diamonds.

                    Moissanite sparkles with more brilliance than most diamonds due to its doubly refractive nature, while diamonds are singly refractive. This means that moissanite can have more fire and brilliance than natural diamonds. Additionally, moissanite is an incredibly strong gemstone, making it a durable choice for everyday wear, ranking just below diamonds on the Mohs hardness scale.

                    Natural moissanite is formed from silicon carbide and is incredibly rare, found in only a few locations on Earth. Most moissanite used in jewellery is lab created, offering the same material properties and beauty as natural moissanite, but with a more accessible and sustainable production process.

                    A diamond simulant like cubic zirconia and others, such as zirconium dioxide, are man-made materials that are designed to resemble real diamonds. However, the chemical makeup and physical properties of a simulated diamond differ significantly from pure carbon diamonds. Lab grown diamonds share the same fire, sparkle, and hardness as mined diamonds and can't be differentiated by the untrained eye, while simulants like cubic zirconia are softer and less durable.
